# Formatting rules:

# Line
# 1: Non terminal chars
# 2: terminal chars
# 3: start char (non terminal ofc)
# 4+:   For each non terminal symbol we have S > result1 | result2 | ... | resultN
#       Spaces must be respected before and after bigger symbol
#                                before and after pipe symbol
#       Non terminal symbols stay between <> because I want to be
#       Abbple to have uppercase terminal chars.
